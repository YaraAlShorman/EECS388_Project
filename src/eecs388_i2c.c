    -Task 1: breaking 12 bit into two 8-bit
    Define the function created that recieves a 12 bit number,
    0 to 4096 and breaks it up into two 8 bit numbers.

    -Assign these values to a referenced value handed into
    the function. 

    Example of `breakup` being called from main: 

    uint8_t variable1;
    uint8_t variable2;
    int numToBreakup = 2000;
    breakup(numToBreakup, &variable1, &variable2);

    // After breakup returns, the three variable values
    // numToBreakup == 2000 (not modified)
    // variable1 == the least significant byte of 2000       == 1101 0000
    // variable2 == the next least significant byte of 2000  == 0000 0111

/* Changing Steering Heading */
/*
    -Task 2: using getServoCycle(), bufWrite, bufRead, 
    breakup(), and and metal_i2c_transfer(), implement 
    the function defined above to control the servo
    by sending it an angle ranging from -45 to 45.

    -Use the getServoCycle function to get the value to 
    breakup. 

    ex: 
    int valToBreak = getServoCycle(45);
    // getServoCycle returns the PWM mapping of steering angle -> duty cycle
    // the above line sets valToBreak to 355
    
    -Note: the motor's speed controller is either 
    LED0 or LED1 depending on where its plugged into 
    the board. 
        If it's LED0, use PCA9685_LED0_ON_L
        If it's LED1, use PCA9685_LED1_ON_L

    -Example use from main function:
    steering(0); -> driving angle forward

    -After writing 280, include a 2 second delay in order to calibrate

    -Note: the motor's speed controller is either 
    LED0 or LED1 depending on where its plugged into 
    the board. 
        If it's LED0, use PCA9685_LED0_ON_L
        If it's LED1, use PCA9685_LED1_ON_L

    -Example use from main function:
